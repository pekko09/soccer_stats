# Soccer Statistics 

**Summary:**  
This project is used to query current match fixtures of professional German soccer teams in the following competitions: Bundesliga 1, DFB-Cup, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Euro League.
Currently it creates an *.ics calendar for Borussia Dortmund which can be used in iOS, Android, MS and Google-Calendars. The calendar is regularly updated as match days are updated in several intervals by the DFL.
This project is a fun development project to experiment with Python, APIs, and GitHub Actions. It has no commercial purpose.
